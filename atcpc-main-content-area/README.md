## Simple Content Repeater UI Extensions for Contentful
Providing a way to add, remove and manually sort small chunks of content in a single field without using References in Contentful.

Currently, the fields are hardcoded (Headline and Content).

Uses React-Quill as a WYSIWYG editor for the content field and React Sortable HOC

### TODO
1. Add configuration settings to customize what fields are used in each item
2. Truncate long content to optimize vertical space
